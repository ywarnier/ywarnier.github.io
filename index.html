<p>Yannick was born in Belgium in 1979 and studied computer sciences at the Paul Lambin Institute in Brussels.
He then moved to England and lived in Portsmouth, Reading and Swindon where he started working for an unnamed open source e-learning project.
He moved to Peru in 2007 without the intention to stay, but he found the environment compelling to develop an e-learning platform that would help education in the 3rd world, so he founded the Chamilo project in early 2010 together with a bunch of like minded Belgians (and a Spaniard) and he's been the benevolent benefactor for life for the project ever since then.</p>

<a name="chamilo" class="anchor" href="#chamilo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chamilo</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/chamilo" class="user-mention">@chamilo</a> project is now used by more than 5000 institutions worldwide with around 5,000,000 users getting access to educational content through their own Chamilo LMS system.
The leadership for the (software) project started to shift with <a href="https://github.com/jmontoyaa" class="user-mention">@jmontoyaa</a> (great international Peruvian-born developer) being the main developer under his leadership.</p>
